# CARL Air Brake Peripheral Devices Software

This repository contains the software for the peripheral devices module of the
[CARL Air Brake][cab-repo] computer. The CARL Air Brake computer automatically
controls a rocket air brake in flight, so that the vehicle attains an apogee at
the desired altitude. Its peripheral devices module (see
[CARL Air Brake Peripheral Devices Hardware][cab-pdev-hw-repo]) contains the
necessary motion sensors and an interface to the brake actuator.

**NOTE**: *This repository is currently work-in-progress. An older version of
the CARL Air Brake was already flown once. Currently, the hardware designs are
being updated and the software is being restructured and improved.*
